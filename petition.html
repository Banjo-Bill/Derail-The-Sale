        <h2>Norfolk Southern Off the Rails!</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>DRAFT Petition to: the Board of Trustees at the Cincinnati Southern Railway and Norfolk Southern</h3>
            <p>Cincinnati is in the midst of an overlapping crisis of capitalism. On November 21st, 2022 Norfolk Southern announced their intention to buy the Cincinnati Southern Railroad, the only city owned interstate railway, which stretches from Cincinnati
                to Chattanooga, Tennessee. This past February, we saw Norfolk Southern’s neglect of railroad safety when a train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, spilling toxic chemicals into nearby water supplies. In the fallout of this disaster, residents
                of East Palestine have suffered headaches, nausea, rashes and other forms of sickness while wildlife withered and died. In response, Norfolk Southern provided the town with only $25,000 in reparations, equating to $ dollars per person.
                Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern insists on expanding their massive railway empire by purchasing the last municipally owned railroad in the United States, the Cincinnati Southern Railroad.</p>

            <p>Norfolk Southern demonstrated their gross negligence by eliminating more than 22 percent of jobs since 2017, resulting in multiple other derailments since November, 2022. In the aftermath of the East Palestine derailment, workers reported
                they were neither offered or provided with protective equipment such as rubber gloves, overboots and chemical restraint suits while conducting activities that exposed them to harmful chemicals. The lack of safety precautions is no accident.
                Norfolk Southern has actively advocated for unsafe and union denounced policies such as precision scheduled railroading, decreased crew sizes, and replacing trained human track inspectors with “automated” systems. </p>

            <p>Time after time, Norfolk Southern has gambled with the lives of community members to grow their already enormous corporate profits. The offer to buy Cincinnati’s railroad comes after the company refused to release necessary financial documents
                relating to the value of the railroad itself. Therefore while the offer to purchase our railroad seems of value, Cincinnatians are denied the right to a neutral, and effective valuation of their railroad. Meanwhile, Cincinnati’s centuries
                old infrastructure is left to ruin. The solution that we are given? A stock market slush fund gamble. A fund which cannot be used for new infrastructure development and which there is no guarantee that returns will match even the previous
                lease terms. </p>

            In the face of Cincinnati’s crumbling infrastructure, clogged highways and streets, lack of public transportation options, and a worsening climate catastrophe, the solution is not privatization. If we ever want railroad infrastructure to be expanded to
            create an equitable, and interconnected society through publicly owned high speed passenger rails, the first step is to maintain the public ownership of CSR. This connected future starts here in Cincinnati.

            <p>Metro Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky DSA stands with railway workers and calls for immediate action to stop the privatization of the Cincinnati Southern Railroad. Our railroad must remain in public hands, with the oversight of railway workers
                and the citizens of Cincinnati. Join us in demanding Norfolk Southern take accountability for its actions!</p>

        <section>
            <h3>We the undersigned therefore demand:</h3>
            <h4>To immediately stop the sale of the Cincinnati Southern Railroad!</h4>
            <p>In accordance with Article XII of CSR - NS Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, we the undersigned demand the Board of Trustees of the Cincinnati Southern Railroad, Norfolk Southern Railway Company, and the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas
                Railways company (CNOTP: an Ohio subsidiary of Norfolk Southern) immediately terminate their agreement to sell the Cincinnati Southern Railroad.</p>
            <h4>An increase in the lease agreement with Norfolk Southern from $25 million to at least $65 million per year</h4>
            <p>
                The value of the Cincinnati Southern Railroad is worth much more than Norfolk Southern is willing to admit. Cincinnatians have a right to a fair lease agreement, and the billionaires at Norfolk Southern must be held accountable.The initial ask of the
                Board of Trustees of the Cincinnati Southern Railroad was $65 million and is a more accurate valuation than the current agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                More compensation for the victims of the East Palestine derailment We demand $1.6 billion be provided to those affected by the East Palestine derailment! This includes but is not limited to: the residents of East Palestine, Ohio, the crew involved in
                the East Palestine derailment, and the workers tasked with chemical cleanup post disaster.
